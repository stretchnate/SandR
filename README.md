# SandR
php search and replace tool

This was developed to help alleviate some of the pain in migrating from php4.4 to php5.3. It used to be called SandD which stood for
Search and Destroy but considering most of the searching resulted in a replace instead it was renamed to SandR or Search and Replace.

Various extensions were added (Ereg, Exclude) to help deal with deprecated methods such as ereg* as well as pass by reference instances
